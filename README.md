# Quantitative Analysis with Pandas

This repo determines which fund has the most investment potential. We are using daily returns, standard deviations, Sharpe ratios, and betas to determine the most worthwhile asset to invest in.

## Technologies

This project leverages python 3.7 with the following packages:

* [pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas) - For DataFrames

* [numpy](https://github.com/numpy/numpy) - For mathematical operations on arrays.

* [pathlib](https://github.com/jazzband/pathlib2) - Allowed us to read in our CSV file. 

* [%matplotlib](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib) - For plotting our DataFrames.

## Usage

To use the quantitative analysis application, simply clone the repository and create a new_folder to save your **risk_return_analysis.ipynb** . Navigate to that folder within your terminal, and type the following :

```new_folder
   jupyter lab
